# Deep Sea Fishing - Android Mobile Application

The Deep Sea Fishing mobile app features use of the following:
- SQLite Database
- Content providers

- Material Design Widgets and Look-and-feel

The current build is stable and deployed OK on Android API Level 15+.

This application was my final project submission for my Mobile Application Development course.
